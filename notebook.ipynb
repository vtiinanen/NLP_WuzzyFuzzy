Major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms (such as deep learning), computer hardware, and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets.[1] High-quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce.'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     38\u001b[0m \u001b[0minput_text\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0minput_text\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0msplit\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'.'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m---> 39\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mclean_data\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mwordcloud_generator\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mpreprocessing\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0minput_text\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     40\u001b[0m \u001b[0mwordcloud_generator\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mcreate_word_cloud\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mclean_data\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n",
